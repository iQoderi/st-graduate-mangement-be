# Contibutions

Thanks for your interest. Before opening an issue or pull request please review these quick points:

- If you'd like to report a bug please reproduce it in [Tonic](https://tonicdev.com/npm/juice) and include the link in the issue
- Pull requests must have test coverage and pass on Travis
- Feature changes should have accompanying documentation updates
- JavaScript standards are defined in the .jscsrc file, please maintain those standards when making changes. The standards are a relaxed version of the Node.js standards.

That's the main stuff, thanks!
